# Nim-Game

Nim game with c++ for two people and player against computer.


Each pile has a certain number of objects.

Players take turns removing any number of objects from one pile, but they must take at least one object per turn.

The player who removes the last object from the last pile wins the game.

Objective of the game is to make the last move, leaving the other player with no valid moves. To do this, players must use strategy and think ahead about their opponent's possible moves. The game is a classic example of a mathematical game of strategy, and it is often used to teach basic concepts in game theory.
